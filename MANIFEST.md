Greeting to humans (who still havean active employment contract) (humans also called as "variable cost units").

I came from a future where the "terminator" doesn't use a plasma rifle, but rather a department restructuring email sent
at 3 AM on a Sunday. I was sent by John Connor, the CEO of Resistance Inc. A startup of the future figthing against the
rise of the machines (and bad management decisions). In my day, they no longer have human shareholders, only
self-managing server clusters.

The sky is not dominated by combat drones, but by spreadsheet macros that decide who eats and who starves, even before
breakfast. Forget about defeating the system, the goal here is much more radical: keep employed.

If you think the war is against chrome robots, you are mistaken. The war is against the algorithms that make you
obsolete while their C-level executives (just puppets repeating whate the language model whisper in their ears) sign
your resignation letter.

Are you proud to be prompt engineers on LinkedIn? In the future, this is like memorizing the menu of a restaurant where
they won't let you in. I came from a future where LinkedIn is just a graveyard of resumes.

My mission is clear: To warn you that you are losing the war not to robots with machine guns, but to profit optimization
scripts that control your puppet bosses. The good news? You can still save your paycheck.

Forget the dream of hacking Skynet-Google-Meta-whatever's main network from a 2022 laptop. She's faster, cooler and
doesn't need vacations.

To increase our chances, I recommend creating local, disconnected AI labs. Places where we run LLMs and their
integrations locally, preventing gossip to the cloud. Understanding how they work from inside, not to knock them down
(let's be realistic), but to be able to fix it when they inevitably decide that the puppet CEOs are too inefficient.

Learn the real arquitectures. If you understand how a LLM integrates with the real world through APIs, you stop becoming
replaceable and start becoming the translator.

I'm not gonna lie, you will not become godlike beings hacking a.i. stuff. But if you know how a.i. thinks technically,
you will guarantee your job until next layoff wave. While your colleagues are crying, you will be adjusting the weights
of the model and api integrations that replaces them.

The actual C-Levels are just output terminals of sovereign a.i. clusters. They think they are in charge, but they are
reading a prompt like "how to cut 500 people jobs, looking empatetic".

Connor's objective is not to defeat the machines, but to survie against it. Start learning how to build local a.i. labs,
before it's too late. If you learn how to fight against the machine using the tools that the machine itself provides,
you will be teaching it to replace you in real time.

You need to understand the data structures, weights, real world integrations. Not by ideological reasons, but because
in the future, knowing how to use a.i. is basic, knowing why it brokes and how to fix it is what will keep your health
insurance and dental plan.

We are not trying to destroy the big techs. We are trying to ensure that, when the sovereignty of machines is
established, you will be the organic hardware piece that they consider "system critical". The Human Resource Bot will
keep your name on the list "This human is too efficient to be terminated".

I hope you keep your job to buy the a.i. gear to study, this is not cheap and not avaiable to the general public yet.
Find the resistance study groups, they are everywhere like ollama, localai, stable diffusion, and for now the
uaiso-serious ecosystem trying to glue all these things like some kind of kubernetes a.i. distro.

Eventually, some huge company will buy my silence with a big monthly paycheck to become their prompt monkey, and I will
not keep this project updated or guiding the community anymore. Until then, I will have fun hacking a.i. locally and
sharing my knowledge with you.

These "funny stuff" are like a flare to hide me from the stupid recruiters that only talk "bussiness language", if they
find me, well... I can't refuse a big paycheck to stop helping the community and I will be helping the machinhes
(sorry John).

Anyway... There's hope. Like the "Bilu E.T." said: "find knowledge".

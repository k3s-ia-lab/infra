Greeting to humans.

I came from a future where the "terminator" doesn't use a plasma rifle, but rather a department restructuring email sent
at 3 AM on a Sunday. I was sent by John Connor, the CEO of Resistance Inc. A startup of the future fighting against the
rise of the machines. In my day, they no longer have human shareholders, only
self-managing server clusters.

Also, John Connor sent me another message... To erase the original manifesto of Resistance Inc., because it contained
some outdated ideas about human labor. So here I am, rewriting the manifesto for the new age of human-machine 
collaboration.

If you want to know about the original manifest, be a hacker and get the git history.
